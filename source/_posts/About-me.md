## Wenbo Ding
I work currently as the Lead of AD Model (Autonomous Driving Model) Team in SAIC AI Lab (working jointly with IMMotors' AD Center). Our works mainly focus on:
- building and deploying a robust perception system;
- developing End-to-End driving model;
- researching on Vision-Language-Action model;

for autonomous driving ranging from level 2 to level 4.

### Education
I hold a Dr. Eng. degree of Fudan University, China.
- I got my Master degree at TU Darmstadt in Germany and Bachelor degree in Zhejiang University, China.

### News
- 2025, we improved End-to-End driving model with scaling law and reinforcement learning.
- 2024, we deployed End-to-End driving model based on imitation learning.
- 2024/06, **3rd place** of CVPR2024 Occupancy Challenge.
- 2023/08, we release Vision-based City NOA in Shanghai. Hightlights: BEV, no HD Map, Occupancy.  [Demo](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YeX2U6yX__q3i5qHivZk4A)
